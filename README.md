# 📊 Fundraising Gaps Analysis – Indian Startup Ecosystem

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project analyzes **why many startup founders struggle to raise funds** despite building in a fast-growing ecosystem.
Using real Indian startup funding data, the analysis uncovers **structural mismatches** between founder activity and investor behavior across **sectors, stages and cities**.

The goal is to move beyond assumptions and provide **data-backed insights** that founders can use to **reposition their fundraising strategy**.



## 🎯 Key Questions Addressed

* Which sectors are **overcrowded vs investor-favored**?
* How does funding vary across **startup stages**?
* Where is venture capital **geographically concentrated** in India?
* Why do founders often feel ignored by investors despite traction?



## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data cleaning, transformation and analysis
* **Tableau** – Interactive dashboard and visual storytelling
* **Google Slides** – Executive-style presentation of insights



## 📂 Dataset

* **Indian Startup Funding Dataset**
* Cleaned and standardized to:

  * Remove inconsistent sector and city names
  * Convert funding from USD to **INR Crores**

  * Exclude non-Indian locations



## 🔍 Analysis Highlights

* **Fintech, Ecommerce, and Finance** receive significantly higher funding per startup
* Most startups exist in the **Early Stage**, while most capital flows to the **Late Stage**
* Funding is heavily concentrated in **Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurugram and Delhi**
* Fundraising challenges are often **structural**, not personal founder failures
